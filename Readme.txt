The following are the requirements for running the code and getting the desired results:
	1. Python 2.7 or higher.
	   Note : If higher version of python is taken like 3.5, you would have to make some changes in the print statement of adding the brackets -> "()"
	
	2. The following librabies must be installed in order to see all the results without any warnings or exceptions:
	   (i)   Numpy
	   (ii)  Pydot
	   (iii) Graphviz
	   (iv)	 Matplotlib (which is a subset of pyplot)
	   (v)   Cvxopt
	   (vi)  mklib
	   (vii) numpy-mkl
	   
	   Note - 1. 'Numpy-mkl' is a dependency for 'cvxopt'
			  2. 'Mklib' is a dependency for 'numpy-mkl'
			  3. Install Pydot after installing Graphviz, otherwise you may get the error of linking like - "dot.exe on found"
